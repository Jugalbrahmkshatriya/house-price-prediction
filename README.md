# House Price Prediction 🏠

A machine learning project to predict house prices based on real-world features using regression models.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

House price prediction is a classic but highly practical machine learning problem.  
This project focuses on building a **robust regression pipeline** to estimate house prices using multiple property-related features.

Emphasis is placed on:
- Feature analysis
- Model comparison
- Realistic prediction accuracy

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Accurate house price estimation is important for:
- Buyers & sellers
- Real estate platforms
- Financial institutions

This model helps predict prices based on historical housing data.
